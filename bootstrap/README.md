# CopilotKit x LangGraph bootstrap

This project is a simple example of how to use CopilotKit with LangGraph to create AI agents, supporting rich interactions between AI models and users. You can use this project as a starting point to build your own AI agents and chatbots.

This readme assumes you're familiar with Python, LangGraph, and Next.js/React. (If you're new to Python, check out the [complete setup docs](./full_setup.md).)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install Next.js/JS dependencies
npm install # or pnpm install, yarn install, etc.

# Create a new Python virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Next app and Python service
npm run dev
```
